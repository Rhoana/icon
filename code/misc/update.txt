Hi Verena,

that's cool, I can give an update through email.

I started coding the learning model and put in place the following:

- logic for creating training data: i.e extracting user-samples based 
  on input from web-interface (no web-interface yet, just manually 
  specifying the inputs for testing). The inputs are in the form of 
  pixel x,y coordinates and corresponding class label.

- logic for creating test data: i.e., transforming each pixel in
  the input image to a sample with the same number of features
  as the training set.

- Next, I am going to setup the classifier and start the training
  and testing to see how things goes. 

- I was wondering if its possible to FTP get stuff from my account?
  Basically, since I'm using terminal into the server to do my work
  I would like to see the results on my desktop on ipython or something.
  Right now I have to upload into a git first and then download from
  there to my desktop.

PS: Disney Research is extending me an offer for summer internship
    at their Cambridge office to work on a project.  I was going to
    tell you about it today.
