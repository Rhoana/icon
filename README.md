ICON is an interactive tool for training deep neural networks for image segmentation tasks. A user enters sparse annotations over a web-based user interface to train a classifier running on a high-performance GPU-enabled server. The classifier produces pixel confidences that are rendered as an overlay on the user interface to guide the the annotation process. The server needs to be setup only once on a single machine or a cluster; and the end users require a browser (Chrome or Firefox) to access the system.

# EXECUTION

1. Run install.sh once, to setup the system 
   (This should be done on a linux system)

2. Start the web server by running:
   sh web.sh

3. Start the training thread by running:
   sh train.sh

4. Start the segmentation thread by running:
   sh segment.sh

5. Access the UI by launching the following URL
   on a browser:
   http://localhost:8888/browse

   Then select a project from the drop down list.
   Press the start button to activate a project
   or stop to deactivate.  Only one project can
   be active at a time.
